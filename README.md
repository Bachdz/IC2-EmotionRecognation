# IC2-EmotionRecognation

This project was generated with [Node.js] version 14.16.1 and [Python] version 3.10.6.
It is part of my work in the Independent Course 2 at HTW Berlin under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Gefei Zhang. 

## Install the required dependencies

Run `npm install` to build and install the added libaries for the webapp.

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required libaries for the python scripts, which are used to train the models and run the detection.

## Extract the pre-trainied models

All pre-trained models are included in the project directory within the `models.rar` file.
Before run the detection `main.py` script, as well as to make the app run properly, please extract all the models from the rar file.

## Development server

Run `npm run dev` for a realtime dev server with nodemon . Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
